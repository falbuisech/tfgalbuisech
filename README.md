The aim of this Project is to specify and design a web application based on HTML5 and oriented to easy the design and supervision of communication networks through graphic editing and visualization facilities. This kind of tools may be applicable to many diverse scenarios. For example, in monitoring the status of a network, defining a simulation playground or even the deployment and supervision of a virtual network. When designing the tool, a flexible result is looked for so it can be applied in any of the scenarios mentioned. Nevertheless, the use case chosen for the Project has been the network virtualization. This way, the application allows the definition of a bunch of gear that afterwards can be instantiated in order to build de net scene. The tool allows the edition of all equipment’s properties such as IP address, Operative System image… It is also possible to define the physical situation of the network’s elements on the screen and connections with other machines. This way, the tool makes possible the definition of a graphic scheme of the network which will include annotations from which the virtualization software will be able to deploy the desired net scenario. Moreover, once with the deployed scenario, the tool could be used to visualize the status of the network, check nodes’ statistics or even apply operations upon them such as turning on or off.
